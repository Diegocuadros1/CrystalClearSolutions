          <strong>What is the Water Fed Pole System?</strong> <br />
          Our Water Fed Pole System is a revolutionary cleaning method that
          utilizes purified water to achieve sparkling clean windows, frames,
          and sills without the need for harsh chemicals or detergents. It's an
          eco-friendly and sustainable solution that aligns perfectly with our
          commitment to environmental responsibility. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>How Does It Work?</strong> <br />
          The system features extendable telescopic poles, allowing us to reach
          windows at heights of up to 4 stories from the ground. Purified water
          is pumped through the pole and released through specialized
          soft-bristle brushes. As the water gently agitates the surface, it
          effectively loosens and lifts dirt, grime, and pollutants. <br />{" "}
